\chapter{introduction}
ship stuff: what, why, etc



\chapter{SBT}
\begin{itemize}
	\item structure of the sbt: 2000 cells etc
	\item woms 
	\item sipms
	\item readout
	\begin{itemize}
		\item amplifier
		\item digitizer
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Setup}
\begin{itemize}
	\item sipm
	\item emusic
	\item emusic board
	\item test setup
	\begin{itemize}
		\item black box
		\item power supply
		\item led setup
		\item readout osci
		\item Gandalf?
	\end{itemize}
	\item DESY testbeam setup
	\begin{itemize}
		\item One cell prototype
		\item turnable table
		\item silicon pad
		\item wavecatcher
		\item HV power supply
		\item power supply
		\item   
	\end{itemize}
	\item Wavecatcher
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Testing of the eMUSIC board}
\begin{itemize}
	\item pole-zero settings
	\item dark count spectra for 1 and 5 sipms
	\item saturation
	\item digital?
	\item fast or?
	\item other problems? (input offset voltage etc?
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Performance at the testbeam}
\begin{itemize}
	\item performed for 5 days without unexpecter problems
	\item saturation was seen with high impedance output
\end{itemize}

\chapter{long term performance setup}
\begin{itemize}
	\item one cell prototype supposed to be running for a year
	\item Digitizing with Gandalf
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Conclusion and outlook}
\begin{itemize}
	\item eMUSIC board was tested
	\item need for improvement regarding the range
	\item possible improvements regarding nice to have features
	\item work consistantly during the testbeam
	\item long term performance is running
	\item outlook for the 4 cell prototype 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item in principal usable 
		\item ideally fix the output range problem
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
