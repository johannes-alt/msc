So far the best physical description of the universe is provided be the \ac{sm}.
But through observations of different phenomena, which the \ac{sm} can not explain, like neutrino oscillation \cite{} and the rotation velocity in galaxies \cite{}, it is known, that the \ac{sm} can not be a complete theory \cite{}.
Therefore different experiments are in developement or are operating to search for new physics and new particles outside the \ac{sm}.
One possible future experiment to join the search for new physics is the proposed \ac{ship} experiment.
It is an intensity frontier experiment using the \SI{400}{\giga\electronvolt} proton beam from CERNs \ac{sps} and dumping it into a fixed target in order to observe rare events.
It searches for long lived heavy particles from the so called \ac{hs}, for example heavy right-handed leptons, dark photons and light dark matter \cite{}.
In order to detect these rare events \ac{ship} is planed to be a zero background experiment.

\autoref{fig:ship_sketch} shows the overall structure of \ac{ship}.
The \SI{400}{\giga\electronvolt} protons get dumped into a high density target, for example a target out of tungsten.
Through the interaction between the protons and the target \ac{sm} particles and \ac{hs} particles can be produced.
In order to remove the \ac{sm} particles two shieldings are used.
The first one is a hadron absorber which is placed behind the target to absorb produced hadrons and electrons.
Afterwards the muon shield utilizing magnetic fields to deflect the produced muons out of the beam line.
So only neutrinos and \ac{hs} particles remaine.
After a muon shield is a neutrino and scattering detector for secondary science cases.
The next part is the \ac{hs} decay volume.
It is a \SI{50}{\meter} long vacuum chamber in which the \ac{hs} particles can decay into \ac{sm} particles.
The decay products than get detected in the decay spectrometer behind the \ac{hs} decay volume.
With the data produced by the decay spectrometer the events can get reconstructed.

%One of these experiments is the proposed \ac{ship} experiment.
%Observing such rare events requires a high interaction rate.
%To achieve this, \ac{ship} is planned to be a beam dump experiment at the \ac{sps} accelerator ring at CERN, as shown in \autoref{fig:sps_ship}.
%The goal is to dump the high intensity \SI{400}{\giga\electronvolt} proton beam into a fixed target and thereby creating long lived particles outisde of the \ac{sm}, e.g. heavy neutral leptons and light supersymmetric particles \cite{ship}.

%In \autoref{fig:ship_sketch} the overall struckture of \ac{ship} is shown.
%At the beginning, the \SI{400}{\giga\electronvolt} gets dumped into the fixed targed.
%Through the many interactions happening at the target, a lot of \ac{sm} particles will be created.
%In order to block the \ac{sm} particles, two shields are placed after the target.
%The first is a hadron absorber in which all \ac{sm} particles except muons and neutrinos are absorbed.
%The second is the muon shield. 
%It uses magnetic fields to deflect the muons away from the beam line.
%The neutrinos cannot be blocked or deflected, but they are likely to be detected in the scattering and neutrino detector behind the muon shield.
%After the neutrino detector a \SI{50}{\meter} long vacuum chamber is positioned.
%If a non \ac{sm} particle is created at the target, is can decay inside the vacuum decay chamber back into \ac{sm} particles.
%The decay products than get measured in the decay spectrometer behind the decay chamber.

Most standard model particles get absorbed by the hadron absorber directly behind the targed. A magnetic muon shield deflects the muon, which won't be absorbed by the hadron absorber, away from the beam line. After the muon shield is a scattering and neutrino detector and afterwards the \SI{50}{\meter} long decay volume in which non standard model particles created at the target can decay into standard model particles. To achieve the zero background goal, the Sourrund Background Tagger is around the decay volume. Behind the decay volume the decay spectrometer is placed. \cite{ship_coll}}

One problem for the measurement are \ac{sm} particles entering the decay volume and getting falsely reconstruced as \ac{hs} events in the spectrometer.
An example of such a background are muons deflected by the muon shield but afterwrads reflected by the walls of the facility into to decay volume and mimicing the decay products of a \ac{hs} event in the spectrometer.
Therefore it is crucial for the zero background requirment to detect the particles entering the decay volume and tagging every event that could be caused by the entering particle as background.
This task is meant to be done by the \ac{sbt}.
As the name suggestes, it sourunds the \ac{hs} decay volume, detecting particles entering it.
It is currently in developement and this thesis is part of the R\&D effort towards it.
In the following the \ac{sbt} and the principles of the different parts are described.
The details of the different parts important for this thesis are presented in more detail in the next chapter.

To make the tagging of background events possible and efficient and avoid the false tagging of many \ac{hs} events different pieces of information need to be known about the paricles entering the decay volume.
These informations are the energy of the entering particles, the time at which they are entering the decay volume and the space coordinates at which they are entering.
Therefore the \ac{sbt} is designed as a five-dimensional tagger.
It will consist out of approximately 2000 cells that form the walls on the side as well as top and bottom of the vacuum decay chamber.
The structure is shown in \autoref{fig:sbt}.
In order to fit to the overall truncated pyramid shape of the decay volume, the cells have an unsymmetric shape, an example is shown in \autoref{fig:sbt}.
Both of the long edges are parallel, but the shorter sides are not.
The depth of the cells is \SI{20}{\centi\meter} and the wall thickness is planed to be \SI{2}{\centi\meter} \cite{}.
For the detection of particles a liquid scintillator will be filled into the cells.
A particle passing through one or more cells will deposite energy in the scintillator, causing the emitance of scintillation light.
The amount of emited light is corelated to the amount of energy deposited in the scintillator.
Two \acp{wom}, PMMA tubes coated with wavelengthshifting pain, are placed in each cell to collect the scintillation light and guide it to an array of \acp{sipm}.
The signals from the \acp{sipm} than can be amplified, digitized and further processed.
Both a \acp{wom} and a \ac{sipm} array are shown in \autoref{fig:sbt}.

This thesis is in the scope of the R\&D of the \ac{sbt}.
For the R\&D of the \ac{sbt} a prototype of one of the cells was build, with which important parts can be tested.
Starting from the cell's material itself, a reflecting coating one the inside of the cell, the coated \acp{wom} and the \acp{sipm} to name a few.
This thesis is about the readout of the \acp{wom} of the prototype.
Since the \ac{asic} meant to be used for the readout in the \ac{sbt} is in developement by the Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich and not yet finished, another readout is needed for the One Cell Prototype in order to test it.
The next chapter presents the One Cell Prototype with the focus on the \ac{wom} readout.
