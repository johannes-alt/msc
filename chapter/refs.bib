ABSTRACT = {The 8-channel Multiple Use Silicon Photo-multiplier (SiPM) Integrated Circuit (MUSIC) Application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for SiPM anode readout has been designed for applications where large photo-detection areas are required. MUSIC offers three main features: (1) Sum of the eight input channels using a differential output driver, (2) eight individual single ended (SE) analog outputs, and (3) eight individual SE binary outputs using a time over threshold technique. Each functionality, summation and individual readout includes a selectable dual-gain configuration. Moreover, the signal sum implements a dual-gain output providing a 15-bit dynamic range. The circuit contains a tunable pole zero cancellation of the SiPM recovery time constant to deal with most of the available SiPM devices in the market. Experimental tests show how MUSIC can linearly sum signals from different SiPMs and distinguish even a few photons. Additionally, it provides a single photon output pulse width at half maximum (FWHM) between 5–10 ns for the analog output and a single-photon time resolution (SPTR) around 118 ps sigma using a Hamamatsu SiPM S13360-3075CS for the binary output. Lastly, the summation mode has a power consumption of ≈200 mW, whereas the individual readout consumes ≈30 mW/ch.},

abstract = {The silicon-photomultiplier (SiPM) is becoming the device of choice for different applications, for example in fast timing like in time of flight positron emission tomography (TOF-PET) and in high energy physics (HEP). It is also becoming a choice in many single-photon or few-photon based applications, like for spectroscopy, quantum experiments and distance measurements (LIDAR). In order to fully benefit from the good performance of the SiPM, in particular its sensitivity, the dynamic range and its intrinsically fast timing properties it is necessary to understand, quantitatively describe and simulate the various parameters concerned. These analyses consider the structure and the electrical model of a single photon avalanche diode (SPAD), i.e. the SiPM microcell, and the integration in an array, i.e. the SiPM. Additionally, for several applications a more phenomenological and complete view on SiPMs has to be done, e.g. photon detection efficiency, single photon time resolution, SiPM signal response, gain fluctuation, dark count rate, afterpulse, prompt and delayed optical crosstalk. These quantities of SiPMs can strongly influence the time and energy resolution, for example in PET and HEP. Having a complete overview on all of these parameters allows to draw conclusions on how best performances can be achieved for the various needs of different applications.}

      abstract     = {The study of cosmic rays was always driven by the
                      development and application of new technologies to enhance
                      the precision of experiments. In recent years, the huge
                      advancements in the photon detection using SiPM led to
                      outstanding performance of these devices and promise an
                      important step forward in detector technology. In this
                      thesis, their characteristics are studied with special focus
                      on simulating their response and understanding the behavior
                      when being exposed to bright or long lasting light pulses.
                      An SiPM based optical module has been developed to prove
                      their maturity for applications in cosmic ray induced air
                      shower detectors. A perfect candidate for studying its
                      performance is the SSD developed for an upgrade of the
                      Pierre Auger Observatory, AugerPrime. The SSD was designed
                      to improve the sensitivity of the current detector on the
                      mass composition of the primary cosmic rays and to possibly
                      reveal their origin. The SiPM based optical module was
                      installed in prototype SSD at the Pierre Auger Observatory.
                      It has proven excellent performance and allows to study
                      UHECR with good precision.},
