\chapter{\ac{daq} performance at the \ac{desy} testbeam}








After the performance of the \ac{daq} was tested at the testbeam for one week with particles of known energy and known direction of movement, the long term performance of the one cell prototype and the \ac{daq} needs to be investigated.
For this purpose, the one cell prototype is assembled at the University of Freiburg, where it is supposed to be taking continuously data for a year.
