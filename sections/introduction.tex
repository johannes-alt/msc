\chapter{Introduction}
So far the best physical description of the universe is provided be the \ac{sm}.
But through observations of different phenomena, which the \ac{sm} can not explain, like neutrino oscillation \cite{} and the rotation velocity in galaxies \cite{}, it is known, that the \ac{sm} can not be a complete theory \cite{}.
Therefore different experiments are in developement or are operating to search for new physics and new particles outside the \ac{sm}.
One possible future experiment to join the search for new physics is the proposed \ac{ship} experiment.
It is an intensity frontier experiment using the \SI{400}{\giga\electronvolt} proton beam from CERNs \ac{sps} and dumping it into a fixed target in order to observe rare events.
\autoref{fig:ship_sketch} shows the overall structure of \ac{ship}.
