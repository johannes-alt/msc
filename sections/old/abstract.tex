    The SHiP experiment is planned to be a zero background beam dump experiment at the CERN's SPS accelerator. To achieve the zero background goal, the SBT is under development to tag all background events. It is a five-dimensional tagger based on a liquid scintillator. The scintillation light caused by particles traveling through the scintillator is captured by WOMs and detected by SiPMs. This thesis is in the framework of R\&D of these SiPMs. Therefore the Citiroc 1A ASIC was used and tested with a array of 40 SiPMs. Using the Citiroc 1A evaluation board for a compact and easy to use DAQ measurements with the SiPMs in darkness as well as with a controlled light exposure via a LED and a Laser were performed. Also the effects of up to five SiPMs connected in parallel were analysed.
    A calibration of one SiPM and up to five SiPMs in parallel was performed as well as a measurement of the dark count rate.
