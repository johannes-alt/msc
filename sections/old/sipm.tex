\chapter{\ac{sipm}}
Since accurate timing is crucial for the efficient and correct tagging of background events, the \ac{sbt} uses \ac{sipm} as photo sensors. Compared to Photomultiplier tubes the signal rise time of \ac{sipm}s is much shorter and thus the time resolution better \cite{sipm_signal_risetime}.

\section{Temperature influence}
Since dark counts are mainly caused by thermal excitation, the dark count rate depends on the temperature. With increasing temperature the dark count probability increases as well.
